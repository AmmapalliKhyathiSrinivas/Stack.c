Stack Implementation in C

Overview

This project implements a stack data structure using an array in C. It demonstrates basic stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and size management.

Stack Representation

The program uses an array-based stack implementation with a fixed maximum size. It provides various functions to manipulate the stack efficiently.

Features

Stack Initialization: Initializes an empty stack.

Push Operation: Adds an element to the top of the stack.

Pop Operation: Removes the top element from the stack.

Peek Operation: Retrieves the top element without removing it.

Size Function: Returns the current size of the stack.

Check Empty/Full: Determines if the stack is empty or full.

Print Stack: Displays all stack elements.

Usage Example

Sample Input & Output:
Enter stack size: 5
Pushing elements: 10, 20, 30
Stack after pushes: [10, 20, 30]
Top element: 30
Popping element: 30
Stack after pop: [10, 20]
Current stack size: 2
